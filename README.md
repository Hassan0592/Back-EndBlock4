a back-end school management system built for St Alphonsus Primary School using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
The system allows administrators to manage key aspects of school operations, including pupils, guardians, teachers, classes, books, and attendance tracking.
The project was developed as part of a back-end web development module and showcases practical database integration, form handling, user validation, and dynamic chart generation using Google Charts.
